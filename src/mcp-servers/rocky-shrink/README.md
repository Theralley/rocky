# rocky-shrink

> MCP middleware. Wrap any MCP server. Cut the prose. Keep the substance.

`rocky-shrink` is a stdio proxy for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It sits between Claude (or any MCP client) and an upstream MCP server, and compresses the prose fields (`description`, etc.) using the same boundaries as the [rocky](../..) skill — preserving code, URLs, paths, and identifiers while stripping articles, filler, hedging, and pleasantries.

The result: tool catalogs that the model burns fewer tokens to read, with no change to tool semantics.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g rocky-shrink
# or run directly via npx
npx rocky-shrink <upstream-command> [...args]
```

## Use it

Wrap any MCP server in your Claude Code (or other client) config:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fs-shrunk": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "rocky-shrink",
        "npx", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/dir"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The proxy spawns the upstream as a subprocess, intercepts `tools/list`, `prompts/list`, `resources/list` responses, and rewrites the `description` fields (and anything else you list in `ROCKY_SHRINK_FIELDS`).

## What it does NOT touch

By design, v1 is conservative:

- **Request bodies** going to the upstream are passed through unchanged.
- **Tool call responses** (`tools/call`) are passed through unchanged. We don't want to risk silently mutating the data the upstream returns to the model.
- **Identifiers, URLs, paths, and code-looking tokens** inside any prose are preserved exactly. Same boundaries as the parent rocky skill.

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `ROCKY_SHRINK_FIELDS` | `description` | Comma-separated list of field names to compress |
| `ROCKY_SHRINK_DEBUG` | `0` | Set to `1` to log per-field compression deltas to stderr |

## Status

Pre-1.0 — the compression rules and field set may change. The plugin is part of the [rocky ecosystem](https://github.com/Theralley/rocky-skill); see the parent repo for the full skill suite (`rocky`, `cavemem`, `cavekit`, `rockycrew`, `rocky-stats`, `rocky-init`).
